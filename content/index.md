## Linux Users Group # MTU

The MTU Linux/UNIX Users' Group was established to further students' knowledge of Linux and/or UNIX based operating systems. We are all geeks at heart and love to talk about technology. Our meetings are completly open to anyone and we would love if you stopped by. If you are interested in becoming a member or would like more information in general feel free to email us at lug-l@mtu.edu. We run Linux-related events several times a year.

If you are interested in becoming a member feel free to come to a meeting or contact any eBoard member (lug-server-admins-l@mtu.edu).
