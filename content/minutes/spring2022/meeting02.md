We sat around in our zoom call and just talked a bunch. There wasn't a real presentation. I was going to present on a machine learning presentation, but I couldn't care enough to do it. I was supposed to do this Virtual Oasis thing, but not a single person showed up, and I heard that USG never advertised it to new students, so that _probably_ was a good reason why no one showed up.
