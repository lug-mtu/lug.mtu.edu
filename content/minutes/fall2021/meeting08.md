This is the Thursday before Thanksgiving break so no one was going to be around.

### Movie
We watched Happy Feet instead of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy because we thought Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy would be too much, because all we do is goof around anyway.

We had some good hawaiian pizza and made fun of the movie while doing homework.
