### Neofetch
There's a config file and it can print pictures!

### Servers
What do we want to do with them?

* Shell
	* Can we nuke it? Everyone agrees.

* Marvin 
	* Could be the hacking server

* Trillian 
	* Could be the hacking server
	* Use openVPN to connect to it like hackthebox

* Zaphod
	* Pretend the errors don't exist and hope it never dies

* Mirrors
	* Too scared to touch since people actually use this. Let's hope it never dies.

### Ideas

Josh suggested a file uploader. Could be flooded with spam. Maybe only allow `141.219.*` to post, should prevent any bad stuff.

Radio? Who would use it? Who cares?

### Installathon

Good idea, make table tents.

2nd floor of Rekhi? Library?

### Magazine

Continue with it. Write our own pages, then make a master make sure the pages flow together nicely and the aesthetic isn't _too_ bizarre.

### Raspberry pi supercluster

Call it the bakery!

Gives practice to supercomputing.

Try to see if there's an education discount or any way to buy more than 1 at a time.
