Got members user accounts on the shell server.

Showed members the physical location of the LUG servers.

### LUG Internal Updates

We are on week 2 of trying to become a RSO! Emailed another person in hopes to

certain files and Josh and I have been working on trying to figure out how in
the world we can grant him read access without simply disabling SELinux.
