### Scripting

[Using LaTeX for notes](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/)

### Programming

* [Textbooks to read](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) for general computer science.

* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) for good, math-related problems. Beneficial when learning data science languages like MATLAB or Python.

* [Beej's guide to network programming](https://www.beej.us/guide/bgnet/) is very excellent for networking (UDP/TCP) using C.

* [Handmade hero](https://handmadehero.org/) is a good resource for learning how to _actually_ program a video game. No game engine, writing it "from scratch".

* [Beginner/intermediate programming projects](https://github.com/ashier/martyrs-mega-project/) for when you don't know what more to do.

For advanced projects, I have:

* [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) you can join LUG's private leaderboard (`867143-1e999d32`).

* [Cryptography programming](https://cryptopals.com/). It gets very difficult, very fast.

* [Eudyptula challenge](https://github.com/agelastic/eudyptula/blob/master/README) is a challenge for programming the Linux kernel.

* [Generic projects 1](https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/challengingprojects.html).

* [Generic projects 2](https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/morechallengingprojects.html)

* [Build your own X](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x)
